## Starter safety

This starter must not ship maintainer-only checkout paths, private workflow
rules, secrets, or local-machine assumptions. Put those in untracked personal
instructions or in a private fork-specific memory file instead.

Worktree changes are isolated. Before claiming a template change is available
somewhere else, verify the exact branch or checkout the user asked about. Do not
merge, pull into another checkout, or touch paths outside the current workspace
unless the user explicitly asks in the current session.
